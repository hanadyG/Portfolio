							Hi, I'm <strong> Hanady </strong>! <br> 
							
							Hello, I am Hanady !
I am currently pursuing the <strong>Computer Sciences Master’s degree </strong>at <strong>Technical University of Munich</strong> (TUM) and am currently working on my second master’s thesis at <strong>Fraunhofer IKS </strong>focusing on quantum CNN supervised by Jeanette Lorenz. <strong>My expected graduation from TUM is by the end of March</strong>. 
I finished my <strong>engineering studies</strong> in France last year at <strong>École Polytechnique</strong>. My master’s thesis tackled explainable AI, specifically "cognition-based clustering and its use in relevant descriptions", under the supervision of Jean-Louis Dessalles at <strong>École Telecom Paris</strong>. Throughout my experiences, I have been keen on developing my skills in artificial intelligence and have been involved in many areas: <strong>Robotics</strong> (solving the robotic reaching task using a spiking neural network), <strong>Quantum Computing</strong> (second master thesis), <strong>Cognitive Science</strong>(first master thesis), <strong>Theoretical AI</strong> (infinitely large transformer networks and their Laplace operators), and <strong>Mathematical dataset creation </strong>(creation of LEAN datasets <strong>commissioned by Meta</strong>, formerly Facebook). I have also worked on a practical software project in order to gain an understanding of technical skills required to develop a complete project.

<p>You can find my resume <a href = "CV.pdf" class = "link" >  <b> here</b>  </a>  and further details about the projects I have worked on in this portfolio.</p>

									<h2>Cognition-based clustering and its use in relevant
										descriptions</h2>
										<p>This thesis aimed to consider <strong>clustering as a cognitive process</strong> and to exploit human reasoning to achieve it. The ultimate goal was to achieve optimal clustering with few examples and no parameters. To this end, I have relied on heuristic approaches beyond K-means, based on <strong>Kolmogorov complexity</strong> (which measures the intuitiveness of a feature the intuitiveness of a piece of information) and <strong>contrast</strong> (which compares an object to a given prototype), with the aim of mimicking human decision-making considerations.</p>

									<h2>Formalizing mathematical statements in LEAN</h2>

									<h2>Solving the robotic reaching task using a spiking neural network</h2>
									<p>The goal of this project was to solve a <strong>reaching task</strong> in the Neurorobotics platform using a manipulator robot and <strong>spiking neural networks</strong> (SNNs). </p><p>In each episode, a target point was randomly generated and the goal was to <strong>control the angles</strong> of the manipulator joints so that the end effector would reach that point. The observations were simulation ground truth data such as target pose, current joint angles, and velocities. 
									</p><p>This was a joint project: we each tailored an RL algorithm to the SNN with an appropriate design to encode and decode the inputs and outputs: I chose TD3 and integrated it, then my partner coded A2C. </p>
										<p>The deployment was as follows: RL container :  Training code + GRPC client; Backend containers : NRP backend (Gazebo, NRP, ROS) + GRPC server; Frontend container : REST API communication with NRP Backend + NRP UI on a localhost port (HTTP).</p>

								<h2>StreamifAI </h2>
								<p>The objective of this project was to build a recommendation system in less than 36 hours for <strong> HackaTUM </strong>  as part of the <strong> Hubert Burda Media</strong>  challenge: we won second place against 20 other teams. </p>
								<p>The goal was to avoid having the client grow tired of making decisions about which movie to watch next. The concept we proposed was: take a selfie with your family or a group of friends and a stream will be attributed to you taking into account the compromise factor in an innovative way, using mathematical constraints.
								<p>I proposed the <strong>compromAIse paradigm</strong> and implemented it, cleaned the data and built the <strong>recommendation system</strong> itself. </p>

								<h2>Energy System Design in Europe:
									A Multi-Objective Approach</h2>
								<p>The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive method for <strong>modeling renewable energy systems</strong> in order to achieve renewable energy production that meets all the energy needs of selected European countries. </p><p> The aim was to be realistic from the point of view of <strong>budget optimization</strong>, but also to avoid <strong>public opposition</strong>.  Moreover, in order to examine the interactions with a third objective dimension, another objective was the question of employment, i.e. to <strong>generate a maximum of jobs</strong> in the production of green energy.</p> <p> We worked in pairs on this project;  my main task was to collect data from several official European sites and to choose the objective functions and code them on top of a simple apriori model whereas my partner was mostly coding the other methods once we had a satisfactory model.</p>

								<h2>Plants vs. Zombies: Reinforcement learning to a tower defense game</h2>
								<p>In a four-person team, we developed several <strong>reinforcement learning methods</strong> (policy gradient with or without actor critique module, Deep Q-Network and Double Deep Q-Network) and successfully trained agents to play the <strong>plant vs. zombie</strong> game we developed in a game engine, linked to an OpenAI gym environment.
									We presented the <strong>superiority of policy-free methods </strong>for this environment and how hyperparameters and observation features can be manipulated to improve agent performance.</p>
									<p>I worked mostly on the environment and the balance of the game.</p>
